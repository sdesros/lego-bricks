# Introduction
This is quick coding exercise to allow the user to create a random assortment of lego bricks, display them and then allow the user to sort and filter the bricks based on the overall number of studs.

# Instructions
* Run `npm start`
* Once the page opens:
    * Enter the number of bricks (1-25) and hit generate bricks to get a random assortment of bricks from 1x1 to 10x10.
    * Once bricks are generated, the user is able to enter the minimum desired amount of studs (1-100) and then filter and sort the results by number of studs.

## Notes 
* The colour is dynamically assigned when drawing the brick based on it's position, if you sort, it might reassign a new colour.
* Any filtered bricks are lost, you cannot reclaim them by changing the minimum stud number to a smaller value.

# Proposed next steps
* Add tests
* Clean up the styling
* Having the sorting and filtering form inside of the "BrickCollection" seems wrong, maybe segregate it that up.
* Have the bricks hold onto their colours
* Add ability to reclaim filtered bricks if the minimum stud is reduced enough to re-include them in the set.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
